            <p>I'm currently a third year student studying at the Polytechnic University of the Philipppines. I would describe myself as someone who's fun and outgoing. I love to play basketball and video games. However, most of my time are spent in front of a computer working on my academic workloads. I am interested in the field of AI and Data Science, with Python being my primary programming language.  I am also interested in Web Development, with a small amount of experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>I am adequate in Python and have completed several courses. Python is the primary language that I have used for the development of some projects. Notably, we've used Pyton to create SmartPlate, a desktop application that implements the Fractional Knapsack algorithm to optimize nutrients gained in meal plans. Additionally, we've used Python in the development of Plumber-- our own scripting language which employs pipelining for file automation and general purpose programming. </p>

                <h3>Data Science</h3>
                <p>I am interested in the field of AI and Data Science. Currently, I am taking up courses to develop my skills as a data scientist and learn the various technologies that are commonly utilized in this field. Moreover, our current thesis direction employs machine learning algorithms for the detection of adversarial attacks in malicious URL redirections.   </p>
